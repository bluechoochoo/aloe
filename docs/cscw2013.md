CSCW2013 Pipeline
====

To use the CSCW2013 pipeline, run ALOE with "CSCW2013" as follows:

This pipeline includes the functionality described in the following paper:

The pipeline involves using a segmentation procedure to group related messages
together, extracting a wide variety of features from the segments, and
using a linear Support Vector Machine classifier to label the segments.

Below, the special options available when using the CSCW2013 pipeline are
explained.

## Train Mode

In "train" mode, the CSCW2013 pipeline accepts the following options in addition
to the basic options.

Note that when the `--roc` option is enabled, logistic models will be fit to the
SVM outputs so that proper probabilities can be extracted. This is necessary for
the ROC curve.

Adjust the class frequencies:
* `--downsample`, `-ds`: Use downsampling in the training data on the majority class to suit the cost ratio.
* `--upsample`, `-us`: Use upsampling in the training data on the minority class in to suit the cost ratio.
* `--balance-test-set`: Apply the selected balancing algorithm to the test set as well as the training set.

Use Weka's CostSensitiveClassifier:
* `--reweight`, `-rw`: Reweight the training data to suit the cost ratio.
* `--min-cost`: Train a classifier that uses the min-cost criterion.

Set custom mis-classification costs:
* `--fn-cost COST`: Set a cost for false negatives (default 1).
* `--fp-cost COST`: Set a cost for false positives (default 1).

Segmentation options:
* `--ignore-participants`: Ignore participants during segmentation.
  By default, messages from different participants are teased apart into different segments.
* `--threshold SECONDS`, `-t SECONDS`: Segmentation threshold in seconds (default 30).
   A gap between messages of more than this threshold starts a new segment.
* `--no-segmentation`: Disable segmentation (each message is in its own segment).

Other options:
* `--emoticons FILE`, `-e FILE`: Custom emoticon dictionary file (default *emoticons.txt*).
* `--folds FOLDS`, `-k FOLDS`: Set the number of cross-validation folds (default 10, use 0 to disable cross validation).

## Label Mode

Set custom mis-classification costs:
* `--fn-cost COST`: Set a cost for false negatives (default 1).
* `--fp-cost COST`: Set a cost for false positives (default 1).

Segmentation options:
* `--ignore-participants`: Ignore participants during segmentation.
  By default, messages from different participants are teased apart into different segments.
* `--threshold SECONDS`, `-t SECONDS`: Segmentation threshold in seconds (default 30).
   A gap between messages of more than this threshold starts a new segment.
* `--no-segmentation`: Disable segmentation (each message is in its own segment).
